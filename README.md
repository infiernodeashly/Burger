## Usage

This application allows the user to select what burger they ate from a list of burgers. To do this, the user selects the “Devour” button beside the burger. The burger will then be removed from the ready-to-eat list to the devoured list, so the user can track all of the burgers they ate. The user can also input their own burgers that will be added to the ready-to-eat list by entering it in the center field and pressing the submit button.
